<p>Using the process you've identified, write, in pseudocode, the series of steps and decisions that would be needed to automate it.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h3 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h3>
<p>Using the pseudocode you've created, draft a flow chart. Include inputs, decisions/branching, loops, etc.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h3 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h3>
