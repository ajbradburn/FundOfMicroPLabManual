<p>It may eventually be necessary for you to write your own code for interfacing with such a device, but right now we are going to gloss over the tedious details of doing so, and rely upon the work of other skilled people. We will import libraries for an OLED display as well as an AHT20 Temperature and Humidity sensor. These libraries take care of sending and receiving the bytes of data that are necessary to make these useful to us. We are going to focus on the process of wiring up these new sensors on the <span class="process-math">\(I^2C\)</span> bus, and making use of them for our own purposes.</p>
