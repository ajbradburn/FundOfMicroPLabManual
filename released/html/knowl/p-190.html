<p>The for loop is useful for situations where you know how many elements you're going to be dealing with ahead of time. As an example, if you have a list of items, and you want to perform an operations for each item in the list, using a for loop is very convenient, as it will execute the code in the loop once for each item in the list, and make that item available to you for use. On line 78 a for loop is used to iterate over a list of every possible roll of N die. With each iteration of the loop, the item in the list is made available in the variable <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">rv</code>. That variable is then used to do some calculations related to probability, and the data is saved to the stats data structure for later use.</p>
