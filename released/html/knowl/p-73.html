<p>This set of exercises will introduce you to a couple of different programming paradigms. The first is lower-level programming languages that covers very simple steps, and demands a great deal of knowledge of the underlying system. As a result, they don't get you very far very quickly, and thus, it is pretty difficult to go from idea to finished product. The second is high-level programming languages that have lots of inbuilt functionality, don't require a great deal of familiarity with the underlying system, and enables you to program a solution quickly. However, as a result, they do abstract away a lot of the underlying principles of the machine.</p>
