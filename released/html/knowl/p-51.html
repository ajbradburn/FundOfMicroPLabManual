<p>This process can seem tedious, but it is at the root of making computers do what you want them to do. Take a moment to reflect on just how difficult it would be to explain to a 2 year old the process of making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The explanation would require details for everything from the process of growing peanuts, making peanut butter, baking bread, and preparing jellies, to slicing bread, and the proper tools for applying the core ingredients. Now, take a second to reflect on just how difficult it is to explain the same process to a rock.</p>
