<p>Let's say a friend comes to you and says they are hungry. Our first assessment of the problem indicates that the real problem is a lack of food. Providing food will eliminate the hunger. We offer a solution of a PB&amp;J. Our friend accepts that solution, and they eat the sandwich. As they make progress on the sandwich, they realize that the bread and the peanut butter are making it a bit difficult to eat the sandwich, and that they could really use something to wash it down.</p>
