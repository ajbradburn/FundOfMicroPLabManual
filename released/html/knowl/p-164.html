<p>With the Raspberry Pi, you can make use of any number of programming-languages, but we are going to focus on Python. It is an interpreted language, this means that it isn't necessary to compile the program you write. Additionally, Python has comparatively liberal data typing, which makes it a bit easier for a beginner to deal with strings of letters, integers, and floats. While data typing is very important, and has it's place in Python, it is less of a learning hurdle with Python than with a language like C, or C++.</p>
