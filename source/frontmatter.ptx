		<p>
      This lab manual is currently a work in progress, and likely to contain errors. Additionally, it is likely to age poorly unless maintained. To that end, it is made open source, available for forking and editing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you find errors, please check the version of the product you're using, to make sure it is the newest.
      If the errors exist in the most recent version, please email the maintainer at <url visual="ajbradburn@gmail.com" href="mailto:ajbradburn@gmail.com?subject=Assembly for Raspberry Pi Lab Manual"><c>ajbradburn@gmail.com</c></url> and include answers to the following:
      <ol>
          <li>A description of the error, with screenshots/photo if possible.</li>
          <li>Is the problem in the online version or the PDF version or both?</li>
          <li>What is the URL for the online page, or page number in the PDF that contains the errors?</li>
      </ol>

    <title>Creation</title>
    <p>
      This document was created using <url href="https://pretextbook.org/">PreTeXt</url>. It is a very useful tool, but does require a bit of a learning to get it to work. Thankfully, documentation is pretty good, and the project is currently being maintained. Basic instructions for cloning the project, making edits, and exporting your changes to useful formats are available in an appendix to this document.
